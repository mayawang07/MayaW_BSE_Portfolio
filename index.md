# Automated Cat Laser
Provide your cat have hours of fun using my project, the Auto Cat Laser! It was built using an Arduino Uno R3, two Micro Servos, a breadboard, a laser diode, and lots of connector wires. My modified code allows it to move side-to-side and up-and-down for more cat action.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# First Milestone

My first milestone was getting the laser to shine, wiring the Arduino, and coding the servos. It sounds simple, but it was actually very challenging for me as I had no experience with electronics prior to Bluestamp Engineering and minimal programming experience. I spent most of the first 3 days of camp researching all the different parts in my kit and figuring out what they did. Eventually, I concluded I could get my laser diode to shine using the Arduino Uno and several connector wires. After I successfully got my laser to shine, I decided it was time to wire everything else. I used this diagram as reference: https://content.instructables.com/ORIG/FJ9/DRW4/GZDY7AGV/FJ9DRW4GZDY7AGV.jpg.

My first challenge was being able to understand the schematic itself! There seemed to be so many wires coming out of the Arduino, servos, and laser, and I was initially very overwhelemed and confused. After analyzing the diagram for a while and playing around with the connector wires, I was able to wire up the wires that directly connected to the Arduino pins. I didn't understand how to wire parts that did not connect to the Arduino (for example, connecting the servo and the laser) because I was unable to solder and didn't have a soldering kit anyways. I asked my instructor and learned I had to use a breadboard, another part I was unfamiliar with. However, after even more YouTube videos, staring at the schematic, some trial-and-error, and a handful of tape, I was able to understand how to simultaneously use a breadboard and Arduino. Wiring up the Arduino felt much less stressful after that and more fun, and I was successfully able to wire up the Arduino and get my laser to shine!

Now I could move on to the coding portion of the milestone. After researching Arduino IDE for a bit and how to use it with an Arduino Uno, I installed Arduino IDE on my laptop, imported code for the servos from this website: https://www.instructables.com/CatBot-Automated-Cat-Laser/, and then uploaded onto my Arduino. The first thing I noticed was that one of my servos was moving, but the other one was not. I double and triple checked the code I imported and the wires, but both seemed to have no errors. It turns out I had wired the servos incorrectly, and I had to move and rearrange a lot of connector wires on the breadboard. I followed the scehmatic shown below to rewire the breadboard, and learned that certain colored wires had to go in specific spots on the breadboard. Furthermore, I learned that part of the reason the servo was not moving was because I plugged a wire into a pin without the '~' symbol, which meant it was unable to receive power.!

I plan to modify the code for my third milestone so I can include a motion sensor in this project, but for now, I'm going to move on and work on the mechanical design of the cat laser.
